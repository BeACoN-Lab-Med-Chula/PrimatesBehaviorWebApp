## Getting started

* **Tour** section provides a detailed explanation of the project.
* **Tutorial** section provides a step-by-step guide to implementing the web application's functions.

If your role is a **researcher**, contributing to high-level functions like adding new tasks, it is suggested to first go through **the Web application concept review** to get familiar with thing under the hood of the system.
If you still struggle with the concept, go through the **Django concept review** for an abstract overview of the core framework that powers the system. There is no need for a deep understanding of the framework, as the tutorial section will guide you with clear examples.

If your role is an **engineer**, feel free to navigate through the **Integrated System Implementation** section for an explanation about the apparatus of this project.
